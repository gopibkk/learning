## Real Time Bus Tracker

 This is a Bus Tracker in real time to map out the buses that travel along the route from MIT to Harvard. The mapping uses the MBTA API for data on the Buses latest location update then supplies that information to mapboxgl to display the locations on the map.
 
 Once the MapAnimations.js, styles.css, and index.html are copied the bus tracker will work without issue.

## Future Improvements: 
Add more routes

Add in options to highlight routes
