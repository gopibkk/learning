<h2 id="crud">CRUD</h2>
<p>To create any app, you will need to complete four basic tasks which include: creating some data, 
  reading some data, updating some data, and deleting some data to complete a full data lifecycle. 
  For instance, to create a to-do app, you need to do the following:  </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a to-do item. (Create)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Display the to-do item to the screen. (Read)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make changes to an existing todo item. (Update)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete a todo item. (Delete)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hooks">Hooks</h2>
<p>Hooks allow you to use state and other features of React without having to write a class. 
    They also provide a way to attach reusable behavior to a React component. 
    Hooks &quot;hook in&quot; to React&#39;s features and allow you to avoid class-based lifecycle problems. 
    They are backwards-compatible and do not need to be included in your React applications 
    if you do not want to use them. However, they are a great way to share and maintain stateful 
    logic in your components. </p>
<h2 id="usestate">useState</h2>
<p>In React, state plays a very important role to track the status of a piece of data at any given time. In the past, 
  if you wanted to manage state before hooks, you would need to make a class out of your component. But
  useState allows you to manage state inside your React components without needing to convert your components into a class.  
  useState takes one argument, the initial state, and only uses that on the first render. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html">React.js docs</a> using a counter, 
  displaying a number and managing the counter&#39;s state. Whenever someone clicks on the counter button, the counter increments by one. 
  Now take a look at it first without a hook, using a class component:  </p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = {
      count: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;div&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;p&gt;</span>You clicked {this.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>.count} times&lt;/p&gt;
        <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;button onClick={() =&gt;</span> this.<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>State({ count: this.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>.count + <span class="hljs-number">1</span> })}&gt;
          Click me
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, using a useState hook, look at the same functionality, written in a different way. Note how this code is considerably cleaner. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { useState } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'react'</span>;

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">Example</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [count, setCount] = useState(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>You clicked {count} times<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">button</span> <span class="hljs-attr">onClick</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{()</span> =&gt;</span> setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">button</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, you can declare initial state with the useState hook much faster than in the class example. Also, you don&#39;t have to use the <em>this</em> keyword, as the component can track its own state with useState. </p>

<h2 id="useeffect">useEffect</h2>
<p>The useEffect hook is a great hook to be able to decouple &quot;side effects&quot; 
    from having to use lifecycle methods. A side effect is essentially when a component needs to reach 
    outside its scope of duty and do something else, like updating a title page.  
    The useEffect hook is also a great way to re-run any code you want to run upon a change in your code.
    useEffect replaces using componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate() in class-based components. You can write "side effect" functionality,
    without having to use classes or componentDidMount()/componentDidUpdate(). 
    Here&#39;s an example of useEffect in action.  In this example, useState manages the state of a counter and there is also  a "side effect" of saying hello and telling you how many times you've clicked based on a button being pushed, which is managed with
    useEffect. </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-js">
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { useState, useEffect } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'react'</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Counter = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [count, setCount] = useState(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);

  useEffect(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">`Hi! You've clicked <span class="hljs-subst">${count}</span> 
  times`</span>)
  })

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>( 
    <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">button</span> <span class="hljs-attr">onclick</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{()</span> =&gt;</span> 
  setCount(count+1}&gt;Click Me!<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">button</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Counter</span>/&gt;</span></span>, 
  <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">'root'</span>)
)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="separation-of-concerns">Separation of concerns</h2>
<p>The separation of concerns is important to keep your code clean, easy to read and non-repetitive. 
  This is important, especially in large codebases, because if you  have too much functionality in one file, you won&#39;t be able to 
  re-use your code as easily down the line, and you&#39;ll have to keep writing the same code over and over in order to maintain functionality. 
  In the videos, Professor Sanchez shows you how to refactor your todo list into separate files, including breaking out the functionality 
  of a form into its own separate file.  To see this in action, check out the &quot;Refactoring Forms&quot; video. </p>

<h2 id="react-dom">React DOM</h2>
<p>The ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient 
  way of managing DOM elements of the web page. The React DOM creates an entire virtual copy of everything that is happening on the 
  browser&#39;s regular DOM, and tracks any updates a user makes through the browser. When a user changes something on the webpage 
  (for example, they click a button), the React virtual DOM responds by going to the DOM tree, finding that node that is responsible 
  for the thing that was changed (i.e., the button that was clicked), updating only that node on the DOM tree. 
  This saves time because the entire DOM tree on the browser does not need to be re-built every time an update or a change 
  is made on the browser. </p>
